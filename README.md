# Description

This was a challenging assignment. Heavy on concept & also requires knowledge & application of everything I learned in the last 24 weeks!Not to mention working with Graph QL/Apollo with React. It was quite a learning process to see both server and front end development working from the same local machine. After doing this assignment and not being able to successfully populate the savedbooks page, I have come to the realization that there is small critical knowledge gap I have in the concept of 'context.user' in the authMiddleware function. I plan to work on it, relearn and very soon correct that. Otherwise it was good experience.
